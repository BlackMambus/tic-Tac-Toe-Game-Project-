⭕️❌ Tic-Tac-Toe – The Ultimate 3x3 Showdown

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic paper-and-pencil game of strategy and foresight where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. One uses “X” and the other uses “O”, and the goal is simple yet devilishly tricky: be the first to align three of your symbols—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

🎮 How It Works:
Setup: A 3x3 grid drawn on paper or shown on screen.

Turn-Based Play: Players alternate placing their symbol (X or O) in empty cells.

Win Condition: First to align three of their symbols wins the game.

Draw Scenario: If all spaces fill up and no one wins, it's a tie (aka a “cat's game”).
